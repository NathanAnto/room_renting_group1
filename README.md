- [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Android SDK installation guide](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Git Policies

We use the **git flow** workflow for managing branches:

- All new development must be done in `feature/` branches, branched off from `develop`.
- Feature branches should be named as `feature/<user-story>.<task>-<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/2.4-login-page`).
    - `<user-story>` is the User Story number.
    - `<task>` is the task number.
    - `<short-description>` is a brief summary of the feature.
    
- No direct commits to `master`.
- Pull requests should be opened from `feature/` branches to `develop`.
- Pull requests should be opened from the `develop` branch to `master`.
- Only merge to `develop` when task reviewed.
- Only merge to `master` the sprint is finished.
